# google_homepage

This project is for submitting to The Odin Project's Google Homepage (easy version) Project.

This is also the first project I have pushed to Github. I am very new to this and only used Github after my project was done. I will learn to use Git and Github more.

Hope anyone who stumbles on this page have a nice day.
